# Anti-Evasion detailed explanation:
#
# Plugin creates an "ip-list" for every player that lists all the IPs they log in with.
# Plugin creates an "ip-profile" that for every IP address that lists all players that have logged on with that IP.
#
# When player logs in, it will go to the "ip-list" and check each IP's "ip-profile".
# For each "ip-profile" it will check the accounts associated with the "ip-profile"
# If any of those accounts have an active ban/blacklist, the plugin will know the player is ban evading.
#
# Long-Arms explanation:
#
# After initial checks, it will check each account's "ip-list".
# It will get the "ip-profile" of each IP in the "ip-list" and run all the aforementioned checks.
# If it finds any active bans/blacklists on one of these accounts, the plugin will know the player is ban evading.
#
# Long-arms is stable and working, but is not recommended because 90% of evaders get caught by first check.
